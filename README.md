I'm a 21-year-old full-stack software engineer building open-source projects for public goods.

I am prototyping cutting-edge web3 ideas with [the Moonshot Collective](github.com/moonshotcollective/) (A GitcoinDAO workstream) and creating open-source projects with [Developer DAO](https://github.com/developer-dao).
