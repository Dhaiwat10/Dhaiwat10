I'm a 21-yo web3 builder working on building UIs & devtools like [web3-ui](https://github.com/developer-dao/web3-ui) with React. I work at/am a part of the following orgs:

- [Developer DAO](https://github.com/developer-dao) - I build open source software here
- [Moonshot Collective](https://github.com/moonshotcollective) - I've built several web3 prototypes here
- [Mazury](https://github.com/mazurylabs) - I worked here as a frontend engineer

All of my work is free open source software. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
